My Portfolio.

This is my first website and is really a simple one.
It just contains a small introduction about myself and a few projects I've done with some functionalities added.
The motivation behind this little piece of code is my passion for creating beautiful websites which I was longing for.
You can even access the code, as I have provided both the files(HTML and CSS) along, the code is really simple, you can understand every bit of it with a mere knowledge of HTML, CSS and a touch of JavaScript.
